## Audit Checklist

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| No duplicate numeric prefixes in 01–22 | ✅ Pass |
| Every top-level folder has `00-overview.md` | ✅ Pass |
| Every top-level folder has `99-consistency-report.md` | ✅ Pass (archive uses `readme.md` instead — by design) |
| No app-specific content in 01–20 range | ✅ Pass |
| Slot 13, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20 vacant | ✅ Pass (intentional gaps reserved for future core topics) |
| Cross-references repaired (Phase 8) | ✅ Pass — `node scripts/check-spec-links.mjs` reports 1592/1592 relative links resolve across 789 markdown files |
| Memory index synced (Phase 9) | ✅ Pass — `mem://architecture/spec-organization` listed in `mem://index` Memories block; numeric hierarchy and validation-reports/ folder both reflected |
| Final validation (Phase 10) | ✅ Pass — `validation-reports/` populated with 4 reports (e2e-verification, numbering-collision-scan, reorganization-audit, tier1-foundations-deepdive) |

## Phase 8–10 Closure Notes (2026-04-26)

- **Phase 8 — Cross-reference repair:** Verified clean by `scripts/check-spec-links.mjs` — zero broken relative links across the entire `spec/` tree (789 files scanned, 1727 total links, 1592 relative links checked). No remediation required.
- **Phase 9 — Memory & policy sync:** `mem://index` Core block already encodes the spec organization rule (`Spec organization → mem://architecture/spec-organization`); the Memories list contains the dedicated entry. No additional rule needed for the 01–20/21+/99-archive/validation-reports numbering convention beyond what `mem://architecture/spec-organization` already covers.
- **Phase 10 — Final validation:** `validation-reports/` is populated with the four 2026-04-22 audit reports plus a `readme.md`. The folder is no longer empty; future audits append here.
