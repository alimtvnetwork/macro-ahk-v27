# CI/CD Pipeline — Implementation Guide

> **Purpose**: This folder documents the full CI/CD pipeline for this project.
> It is written to be **AI-portable** — any AI coding assistant should be able
> to read these files and reproduce, extend, or debug the pipeline without
> prior context.

## Quick Overview

This project is a **Chrome extension** with multiple **standalone scripts**
that are built separately and bundled into the extension at build time.

The pipeline has two workflows:
1. **CI** — runs on every push to `main` (lint → test → build)
2. **Release** — runs on push to `release/*` branches (same pipeline + packaging + GitHub Release)
